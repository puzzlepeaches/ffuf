# ffuf - Fuzz Faster U Fool

A fast web fuzzer written in Go.

ffuf forked with some changes defaults. Changes:

* User agent changed to Chrome

```
go get -u -v github.com/puzzlepeaches/ffuf
```

Maybe use this at a later point to store my one liners and stuff like that.

Todo:

* Add a newline when starting to ffuf
* Try to add a flag to choose between some user-agents instead of hard setting it
